# vue-frontend

Vue.js front-end for course editor. 
Needs to be implemented into a WordPress Child Theme, so we don't lose customizations when updated.

Goal is to integrate Vue.js with our WordPress theme and plugins to create Single Page Apps (or SPA Themes). 
Also provide plugins with Vue.js interfaces that leverage features like virtual DOM, reactivity and components.
